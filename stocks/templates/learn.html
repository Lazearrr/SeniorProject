<h1>Total Assets:</h1> 
<p>This indicates the total resources owned by the company. A value investor might be interested in companies with substantial assets that are potentially undervalued.</p>

<h1>Total Liabilities:</h1> 
<p>This shows the company's total debts and obligations. Value investors often look for companies with manageable debt levels.</p>

<h1>Total Shareholder Equity:</h1> 
<p>This represents the residual value for shareholders after deducting liabilities from assets. Positive equity is generally preferred by value investors.</p>

<h1>Book Value per Share:</h1> 
<p>Calculated by dividing total shareholder equity by the number of outstanding shares, this metric gives an idea of the minimum value that shareholders would receive if the company were liquidated.</p>

<h1>Retained Earnings:</h1> 
<p>This indicates the cumulative amount of profits that the company has kept rather than distributed as dividends. Positive retained earnings can suggest a financially stable company.</p>

<h1>Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:</h1> 
<p>Calculated by dividing the current market price per share by the book value per share, this ratio helps assess whether a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued.</p>

<h1>Current Asset:Liability Ratio:</h1> 
<p>This ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. It measures the company's ability to cover short-term obligations with its short-term assets.</p>

<h1>Debt-to-Equity Ratio:</h1> 
<p>This ratio compares the company's total liabilities to its total shareholder equity. A lower ratio may indicate a healthier balance between debt and equity.</p>

<h1>Cash and Cash Equivalents:</h1> 
<p>Having a substantial amount of cash and equivalents can indicate financial stability and the ability to weather economic downturns.</p>

<h1>Inventory:</h1> 
<p>Low inventory levels relative to sales can suggest efficient management and reduced risk of obsolete inventory.</p>

<h1>Intangible Assets and Goodwill:</h1> 
<p>While not directly quantitative, assessing the value and nature of intangible assets and goodwill is important to understand the company's competitive advantage and potential risks.</p>
